_health ai x neuro x bci tech research_

ex-founder @ [__Ocular Diagnostics__](https://oculardiagnostix.com) (venture-backed brain health startup) - worked on ml research for ADHD diagnostics + raised $150K to build custom vr wearables to track ADHD. we were one of the first to successfully use _pupil-size movements_ for early detection of neurological disorders (published in Nature Scientific Reports, ACM, and IEEE). 

received 2024 __NSF Research Graduate Fellowship (GRFP)__ ($160K in grants for 3-5 years master's/phd) for research on _multimodal knowledge graph based LLM interpretability_.

received awards from Columbia CS department for independent research on distilling medical image vision transformers (__Theodore R. Bashkow Award__).

__currently__:
- building internal devtools to forecast and prevent system failures @ __AWS__.
- research on neurostimulation for sensory and emotional modulation.

__prior work__:
- co-founded and led __[Coding for Impact](https://codingforimpact.org)__ (one of the world's largest student-led international development organizations) from 2018-2021, helping deliver tech to underserved NGOs across the globe.

__prior research__:
- worked on _efficient distillation_ of medical image foundation models at __IBM Research__ under _Dr. Kaoutar El Maghraoui_ and low-latency systems research at __Nokia Bell Labs__.
- worked on methods to hierarchically analyze bioinformatics codebases using LLMs (patent-pending) at __[Helix](https://helix.com)__ (leading population genomics company).
- parallelized gene regulatory network inference __[algorithms](https://github.com/wdas03/grnpar)__ in _Haskell_ using boolean networks.
- open-sourced first __[stack](https://github.com/wdas03/sarart-experiments)__ for SARA (self-adaptive robust attention) based robotic transformers.
