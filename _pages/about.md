_health ai x neuro research x bci tech_

ex-founder @ [__Ocular Diagnostics__](https://oculardiagnostix.com) (venture-backed MedTech startup) - worked on ml research for ADHD diagnostics + raised $150K to build custom vr wearables to track ADHD. we were one of the first to successfully use _pupil-size movements_ for early detection (published in Nature Scientific Reports, ACM, and IEEE). 

received 2024 __NSF Research Graduate Fellowship (GRFP)__ ($160K in grants for 3-5 years master's/phd) for research on _multimodal knowledge graph based LLM interpretability_.

received awards from Columbia CS department for independent research in biomedical imaging (__Theodore R. Bashkow Award__).

prior worked on ML research for _efficient distillation_ of medical image foundation models at __IBM Research__ under _Dr. Kaoutar El Maghraoui_, and low-latency systems research at __Nokia Bell Labs__. 

currently @ __AWS__ building internal devtools to forecast and prevent system failures.
